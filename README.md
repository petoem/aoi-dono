## How to setup and use `Aoi`?

### Configure your favourite text editor ...

... by setting one of the following shell environment variables `AOI_EDITOR`, `VISUAL`, `EDITOR` to your editors executable.

### Set your auth credentials and settings ...

... by commandline flags or environment variables. You can use flag `-save-to-config` to save your current credentials and settings to a config file in `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, this way you don't have to pass them in on the commandline.

See `aoi-dono -help` for available options.
